0.20.0
======

Features:
---------
* Perform auto-completion refresh in background. (Thanks: Amjith, `Darik Gamble`_, `Iryna Cherniavska`_).
  When the auto-completion entries are refreshed, the update now happens in a
  background thread. This means large databases with thousands of tables are
  handled without blocking.
* Add ``CONCURRENTLY`` to keyword completion. (Thanks: `Johannes Hoff`_).
* Add support for ``\h`` command. (Thanks: `Stuart Quin`_).
  This is a huge deal. Users can now get help on an SQL command by typing:
  ``\h COMMAND_NAME`` in the pgcli prompt.
* Add support for ``\x auto``. (Thanks: `Stuart Quin`_).
  ``\\x auto`` will automatically switch to expanded mode if the output is wider
  than the display window.
* Don't hide functions from pg_catalog. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_).
* Suggest set-returning functions as tables. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_).
  Functions that return table like results will now be suggested in places of tables. 
* Suggest fields from functions used as tables. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_).
* Using ``pgspecial`` as a separate module. (Thanks: `Iryna Cherniavska`_).
* Make "enter" key behave as "tab" key when the completion menu is displayed. (Thanks: `Matheus Rosa`_).
* Support different error-handling options when running multiple queries. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_).
  When ``on_error = STOP`` in the config file, pgcli will abort execution if one of the queries results in an error. 
* Hide the password displayed in the process name in ``ps``. (Thanks: `Stuart Quin`_)

Bug Fixes:
----------

======

Features:
---------

  Open the config file (~/.pgclirc) and check if you have
  ``wider_completion_menu`` option available. If not add it in and set it to
  ``True``.

0.18.0
======

Features:
---------

* Add fuzzy matching for the table names and column names. 

  Matching very long table/column names are now easier with fuzzy matching. The
  fuzzy match works like the fuzzy open in SublimeText or Vim's Ctrl-P plugin. 

  eg: Typing ``djmv`` will match `django_migration_views` since it is able to
  match parts of the input to the full table name.

* Change the timing information to seconds. 
  
  The ``Command Time`` and ``Format Time`` are now displayed in seconds instead
  of a unitless number displayed in scientific notation.

* Support for named queries (favorite queries). (Thanks: `Brett Atoms`_)

  Frequently typed queries can now be saved and recalled using a name using
  newly added special commands (``\n[+]``, ``\ns``, ``\nd``).

  eg: 

::

    # Save a query
    pgcli> \ns simple select * from foo
    saved

    # List all saved queries
    pgcli> \n+

    # Execute a saved query
    pgcli> \n simple

    # Delete a saved query
    pgcli> \nd simple

* Pasting queries into the pgcli repl is orders of magnitude faster. (Thanks: `Jonathan Slenders`_)

* Add support for PGPASSWORD environment variable to pass the password for the
  postgres database. (Thanks: `Iryna Cherniavska`_)

* Add the ability to manually refresh autocompletions by typing ``\#`` or
  ``\refresh``. This is useful if the database was updated by an external means
  and you'd like to refresh the auto-completions to pick up the new change.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* Fix an error when running ``\d table_name`` when running on a table with rules. (Thanks: `Ali Kargın`_)

---------

* Add support for auto-completing view names. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
* Add support for building RPM and DEB packages. (Thanks: dp_)
* Add subsequence matching for completion. (Thanks: `Daniel Rocco`_)
  Previously completions only matched a table name if it started with the
  partially typed word. Now completions will match even if the partially typed
  word is in the middle of a suggestion.
  eg: When you type 'mig', 'django_migrations' will be suggested. 
* Completion for built-in tables and temporary tables are suggested after entering a prefix of ``pg_``. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
* Add place holder doc strings for special commands that are planned for implementation. (Thanks: `Iryna Cherniavska`_)

* Add auto-completion support for datatypes in CREATE, SELECT etc. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)

* 

Bug Fixes:
